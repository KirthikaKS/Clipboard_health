## DATASET DETAILS
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services publish a quarterly report containing daily staffing data for all registered nursing homes in the U.S. This dataset is called Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing and can be found here. You can review the data dictionary to better understand the data that’s available, but a few notes pertaining to this exercise:
●	Nursing homes are staffed by both employees and contractors. Employees work for the nursing home full time, whereas contractors work for the nursing home on a temporary basis. Most nursing homes are staffed using some combination of full time employees and contractors, but the proportions within each nursing home can vary substantially. All workers from Clipboard Health (and our competitors) are classified as contractors.
●	Clipboard Health is a nationwide staffing platform, operating in all 50 states.
●	There are a variety of other datasets that can be joined to this dataset, all found under the nursing home data section on CMS’ website. 
●	As mentioned previously, the PBJ data is separated by quarter. For this exercise, please focus on the most recent quarter available (2024Q2).
